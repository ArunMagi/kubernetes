Blue-Green Deployment in Kubernetes is a release strategy that reduces downtime and risk by running two environments (Blue and Green) and switching traffic between them during updates.

ðŸ’¡ Concept:
Blue: The current (stable) version of your application.

Green: The new version you want to deploy.

Traffic is routed to either version using a Kubernetes Service.


To switch blue to green 

kubectl patch service my-app-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"app":"my-app","version":"green"}}}'

To switch green to blue

kubectl patch service my-app-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"app":"my-app","version":"blue"}}}'
